Image Encryption Tool


A simple Python-based image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a basic XOR operation. A GUI built with Tkinter makes it easy to select images and input encryption keys.

## Features  
✅ **Encrypt Images** – Apply XOR-based encryption to scramble image pixels.  
✅ **Decrypt Images** – Reverse the encryption using the same key.  
✅ **GUI Interface** – Simple Tkinter-based interface for easy use.  
✅ **Secure Key-Based Transformation** – Uses a user-defined key to ensure encryption security.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-tool.git
   cd image-encryption-tool
